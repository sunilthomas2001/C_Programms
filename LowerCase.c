/*
Write a C program that takes a string from the user and converts all uppercase letters into their corresponding lowercase letters.
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter a sequence of characters. It must then check each character individually. 
If a character is an uppercase letter, the program should convert it to its lowercase equivalent. If the character is already lowercase
 or is not a letter at all, the program should leave it exactly as it is. The final modified string should be displayed on the screen. Pre-requisites: Loops, Strings, Conditional Statements, ACII.
